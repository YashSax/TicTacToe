**Minimax** is a decision-making algorithm representing a two-player competitive game of perfect information where an AI simulates the decisions of the human player and chooses the move that minimizes a loss. More information can be found below:\

\
**Alpha-Beta Pruning** increases the speed of the minimax algorithm by cleverly "pruning" leaf nodes in the search tree that don't effect the final outcome. More information can be found below:\
